# TicTacToe Challenge

This code will generate a Tic Tac Toe GUI Board for 2 players (or you can play against yourself!). This will tremendously help Rob coming up with ways to actually win at Tic Tac Toe.

Since there is no actual starting screen with instructions, here they are below:
* There will be 2 players symbols - X and O. 
* You will click on a square on a Tic Tac Toe board to make your move. And by clicking, I mean clicking with your mouse, no other input (I'm looking at you Rob)
* There is a timer of 10 seconds for each move. It will be counting down on lower left corner
* If the timer ends and you don't make a move, you lost your turn and it's the other player's turn
* If there is a winner or there is a draw, it will be displayed in lower right corner
* If you would like to continue playing, click the CLEAR button and begin a new game. If not, simply close with the close button

Now that you understand the rule. Proceed at your own risk and enjoy!
